**Motivation:**

With the increase in world’s population, the roads have been flooded with the vehicular traffic. It has become increasingly difficult to manage this traffic. One of the increasing problems the roads are facing is worsened road conditions. Because of many reasons like rains, oil spills, road accidents or inevitable wear and tear make the road difficult to drive upon. Unexpected hurdles on road may cause more accidents. Also because of the bad road conditions, fuel consumption of the vehicle increases causing wastage of precious fuel. Because of these many reasons detecting and reporting the existence of potholes to responsible departments can save the roads from getting worse.

**Brief introduction:**

Maintaining high-quality road infrastructure is challenging for numerous reasons, including harsh weather, unexpected road loads, and inconsistent wear and tear. As road damage are highly unpredictable, an infrastructure maintenance program is only as effective as its associated monitoring program.
So we propose a system which will be placed at the dashboard of a vehicle in a sufficient wide angle which will consist of a camera. The camera takes an image or video clip as input and returns a set of frames where the potholes are outlined with squares. Later This scanned data is sent to a custom database along with the location of the potholes. This collected data can be used by the road maintenance department to repair the potholes.

**Objective:**

1. To design a fully developed system to identify Potholes on road.
2. To create a database to log the coordinates of the potholes detected.
3. The coordinates of the detected potholes will be get plotted on the maps.
4. To send this information which will serve as a valuable source to the concerned authorities. i.e.  PWD office.
5. In addition to that, Users can get the real-time information about the potholes on road and can avoid potholes.

**Methodology: **

1. The camera placed in a vehicle will scan the road.
2. The scanned data is sent for extract potholes from other characteristics of the road.
3. When a pothole is detected, the data of the pothole (i.e. depth, width and coordinates) will get updated in a database.
4. 
As shown in block diagram below, the camera scans and the potholes are identified and the data is extracted and sent to the database.
